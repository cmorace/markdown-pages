# Markdown Notes

You will use the Markdown language to generate the contents of your webpage. We have already seen some Markdown in Jupyter text cells. Below is an overview of Markdown and some examples you can use to add content to your page.

## Headings

Headings are the titles used for each of your pages sections. To create a heading in markdown you use one or more `#` symbol, followed by a space, and then the text for your heading. The largest heading uses a single `#` symbol.  For example, the following code written in Markdown,

``` markdown
# Title Heading
## Section Heading
### Subsection Heading
#### Subsubsection Heading
```

will be displayed like this:

# Title Heading
## Section Heading
### Subsection Heading
#### Subsubsection Heading
